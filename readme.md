Your drone / plane gone down in a field and it's hard to find?

## Open this OpenTX/EdgeTX widget, scan the QR, open maps!

- Quick and easy way to find your model.. use your phone!
- Works with your inbuilt telemetry data stream
- Built to support several different mapping methods:
  * QR-code native `geo:` data that opens in your phone's native map app
  * google specific link for opening in google maps specifically
  * GURU maps link for opening in [Guru Maps](https://gurumaps.app) for offline mapping
- can be launched as a standalone script
- can be added as a telemetry widget
- Works from the command line (`lua qrPos.lua 'data'`) .. great for testing!

## Installation & Usage

- Download the code ([direct link to zip](https://github.com/t413/QRious/archive/refs/heads/main.zip))
- Copy to SD Card for your EdgeTx/OpenTx radio
  * Copy `SCRIPTS/TELEMETRY/qrPos.lua` - *with the same path*
  * Copy `WIDGETS/qrPos/main.lua` - *with the same path*
- Add as a telemetry widget on your radio (model edit, last page)
- Run as a standalone script (under system menu, scripts)


## Limitations

- Uses a fair bit of RAM memory
  * as optimized as I could make it– only uses high RAM when actually generating QR code
- Some radios are hard to scan
  * OLED displays (like Tango 2) are hard to scan in daylight
  * Haven't tested color radios
- If you've _lost_ telemetry it won't work.
  * Open/EdgeTX doesn't seem to serve stale telem values.
  * so *works best as a widget* unless you're getting telemetry data

_Example running on my old Frsky X-Lite and in the terminal_

## Testing / Development

This is actually runable from lua on the command line!

Install a `lua` runtime like [LuaJIT](https://luajit.org/download.html), here using homebrew on macOS:

```bash
brew install LuaJIT # or: sudo apt install luajit2
```

Run the script with a `geo:` link:

```bash
lua src/SCRIPTS/TELEMETRY/qrPos.lua "geo:37.87133,-122.31750"
```

This prints debug information about the generation process and the QR code as ASCII to the console. Example output of that command is in the screeshot above.
